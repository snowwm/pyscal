# Pyscal
Syntax from Python and the `program` keyword from Pascal.  
Shameful messy code written in 6 days for a term paper.  
Includes a debugger! :rocket:

### Notable languge features
* an unusual type cast operator
* the "program is a function" idea materialized in syntax

### Facts
* I intended to add a "cool undocumented feature", but in reality the whole thing is undocumented thanks to my lazyness
